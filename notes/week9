Mash

Creating barbed wire, etc.

Create a curve, get two disks, and position them at end of curve.

Extrude along the curve. Get faces and then click the curve, extrude, add divisions.

To Twist it, go to the history of the extrude face, and add to the twist value,very high like 5000

Next we want to put barbs on this "wire" create a helix and make it look like a barb.

We want to use Mash to distribute the object along the curve.

Go to mash tab, click create mash network, Open mash editor, go to mash network and clicj the curve node.

Drag curve from the outliner into the mash network.

Go back to mash network distribute node, set x dist to 0.

Go back to curve node and modify the step to a suitable number.

Barbs are not aligned to curve properly, go back to original barb created, rotate this and notice that all barbs rotate. Fix things so  that it is aligned.

Making things more random.

Go back to mash network, add random node.

Se X rotation to a high value, *or whatever axis you need to rotate around)
